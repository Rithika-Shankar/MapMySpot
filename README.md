# üó∫Ô∏è MapMySpot 
> A smart, web-based parking assistant that transforms the stressful hunt for parking into a smooth, real-time experience.

---

## Inspiration
The idea for MapMySpot emerged from a common urban frustration: **parking is often more stressful than the commute itself**.  

As cities grow denser, we identified several consistent challenges:
- **Wasted Time**: A large share of urban traffic comes from drivers circling for parking.  
- **Unclear Pricing**: Users often discover costs only after arriving.  
- **Context Blindness**: Most tools ignore real-world factors like traffic, weather, or demand.  
- **Feature Gaps**: Existing apps lack favorites, filters, or dynamic navigation.  

MapMySpot aims to transform parking from a guessing game into a **smart, effortless process**.
